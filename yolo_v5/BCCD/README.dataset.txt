# Overview
 
This is a dataset of blood cells photos, originally open sourced by [cosmicad](https://github.com/cosmicad/dataset) and [akshaylambda](https://github.com/akshaylamba/all_CELL_data). 

There are 364 images across three classes: `WBC` (white blood cells), `RBC` (red blood cells), and `Platelets`. There are 4888 labels across 3 classes (and 0 null examples).

Here's a class count from Roboflow's Dataset Health Check:

And here's an example image:

`Fork` this dataset (upper right hand corner) to receive the raw images, or (to save space) grab the 500x500 export.

# Use Cases

This is a small scale object detection dataset, commonly used to assess model performance. It's a first example of medical imaging capabilities.

# Using this Dataset

We're releasing the data as public domain. Feel free to use it for any purpose.

It's not required to provide attribution, but it'd be nice! :)
